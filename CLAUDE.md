# CLAUDE.md — Senti

Operating notes for Claude working in this repo. Read this first.

## What this is

**Senti** — free, 100% local macOS speech-to-text (a Wispr Flow alternative). Hold a
key, speak, cleaned text is typed into the focused app. Verbatim dictation never
leaves the Mac (whisper.cpp server bound to `127.0.0.1`). Optional AI modes
(prompt / command / context) send text — and, with screen context on, a downscaled
screenshot — to cheap cloud APIs.

- **Repo is PUBLIC (GitHub, since 2026-11-11) and MIT licensed**, both the owner's
  decision, see `LICENSE`. The owner's name and Mac username were scrubbed from files *and*
  git history. **Do not reintroduce them** (no real names, no `/Users/<name>/…` paths in
  committed files; use `$HOME` / `__HOME__`).
- **Speech engine: stay on whisper.cpp.** Parakeet was evaluated on 2026-11-11. It only
  beats the warm whisper server if it also stays loaded, and no audited runtime does that
  yet. Upstream whisper.cpp has a `parakeet-cli` on master that Homebrew's 1.9.5 does not
  ship; revisit when a Homebrew release includes Parakeet in the server.
- No roadmap, pricing, or business-entity detail in this repo.
- **The prompting knowledge base lives in `prompts/`** and ships with the repo. It was a
  separate repo (`senti-kb`) from 2026-08-19 to 2026-10-17 and was merged back with its
  history. An earlier plan treated it as a paid artifact to split out before going public;
  that plan was dropped on 2026-11-11. The AI modes need the user's own API key (OpenAI,
  Anthropic or OpenRouter) to run.

## Repo → live system (the mental model that matters most)

This repo is the **source**. It is not where the app runs. `./install.sh` deploys it:

| Repo file | Deploys to |
|---|---|
| `senti-*.sh`, `config.sh`, `ai-models.json`, `replacements.txt`, `prompts/`, `eval/` | `~/.config/senti/` |
| `senti.lua` | `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua` |
| `io.senti.server.plist` (with `__HOME__` substituted) | `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` |
| `app/` | `~/Applications/Senti.app` |
| `uninstall.sh` | stays in the repo; removes all of the above after asking |

**Workflow: edit files in this repo, then run `./install.sh` to deploy.** Don't hand-edit
`~/.config/senti/*` or `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua` as the primary change — those are
install targets and get overwritten. (Exception: `replacements.txt`, `eval/cases.txt`, `brain-map.txt` are user-tunable and
install **only if missing**, so a re-run never clobbers the user's local tuning.
`config.sh` is only-if-missing **plus version-gated**: when `WF_CONFIG_VERSION` bumps,
install.sh backs the old file up to `config.sh.v<old>.bak` and installs the new schema — a
stale config once silently pinned a retired model and made an upgrade a no-op.
Scripts and `senti.lua` are code — always overwritten.)

## Conventions

- **Script naming:** `senti-<role>.sh`. Env vars are prefixed **`WF_`** and the Lua global
  is **`wf`** — these are *legacy from the "Whisper Flow" name and kept intentionally*.
  Don't mass-rename them; it touches every file for no user-visible gain.
- **Secrets:** one key per provider in the **macOS Keychain** (service `io.senti`, account
  `openai` / `anthropic` / `openrouter`), written and read only by `senti-key.sh`. A mode-600
  file `~/.config/senti/<provider>-key` (gitignored) is the fallback when no Keychain item
  exists; `senti-key.sh migrate` (run by install.sh) moves an old file into the Keychain and
  deletes it only after a byte-exact read-back. Programs running as the user can still read
  the key; that is inside the threat model (same-uid code is trusted), so never claim the
  Keychain makes it unreadable to other software.
- **The argv rule (load-bearing):** the key **and every piece of user speech** travel in
  the **environment (`SENTI_IN`), never argv** — `ps -Ao args` is readable by every process
  on the box. This applies at *every* layer: `senti.lua` → script (via `hs.task:setEnvironment`),
  script → script (`SENTI_IN="$X" bash …`), and script → python. Fixing only the innermost
  call is the bug that shipped once already — the wrapper's own command line leaked.
  Keychain writes obey it too: the command reaches `security -i` on **stdin**, built by the
  bash builtin `printf` (never `/usr/bin/printf`, never `security add-generic-password -w KEY`
  on a command line), and reads come back on stdout into a variable. The key charset is
  validated (`^[A-Za-z0-9._-]{8,512}$`) so it cannot break the `security -i` line.
  `senti-selftest.sh` asserts it with a canary. **When writing that assertion, never pipe the
  canary into `grep`** — grep's own argv then contains it and `ps` catches the test itself
  (a false positive that flaps). Snapshot `ps` into a variable and match with a shell `case`.
- **Cache is sensitive:** `~/.cache/senti/` holds the raw audio of what was just said, a
  full-res screenshot, and any selected text. `wf.sweepCache()` clears it at the end of every
  turn, on a 60s backstop, and at launch. Don't add a new cache artefact without adding it to
  the patterns in `wf.sweepSensitive`.
- **Session memory:** keyed on the focused **window id**, not the app — several Claude Code
  terminals are all "Terminal" but are different work. The window title already carries the
  project and current task (`senti — ⠐ Evaluate software… — claude`), so working context is
  free: no screenshots, no API call, nothing leaves the Mac. Files are mode 600 under a 700
  dir and expire after `WF_SESSION_TTL_H` (24h).
- **AI output extraction:** AI modes wrap output in `<r></r>` sentinels and extract with
  perl/sed to kill model preamble. Preserve these.
- **`.gitignore` guards secrets + local state:** `*-key`, `*.pref`, `eval/history.csv`.
  Verify `git status` is clean of these before any commit.

**Script map** (all deploy to `~/.config/senti/`):

| Script | Role |
|---|---|
| `senti-dictate.sh` | record / transcribe / clean — the only path that stays 100% local |
| `senti-ai.sh` | THE single AI call for all 3 providers — text and vision (`SENTI_IMG`), typed exit codes, `last-request.json` |
| `senti-key.sh` | keys (`set` / `test` / `clear` / `status` / `use` / `migrate`) and provider+model resolution |
| `senti-vision.sh` | screenshot + instruction → prompt assembly, delegates the call to senti-ai.sh |
| `senti-lib.sh` | shared `senti_prompt_context` — craft + brain + session + target for BOTH prompt paths |
| `senti-prompt.sh` | rough idea → optimised prompt (fallback path — see path parity) |
| `senti-command.sh` | transform selected text by voice |
| `senti-judge.sh` | prompt quality: legacy 0-10 `score` + discriminating pairwise `compare` |
| `senti-target.sh` | frontmost app → which model's guidance digest to inject |
| `senti-session.sh` | per-window session memory (`note` / `recall` / `sweep`) |
| `senti-brain.sh` | Obsidian vault → capped project digest; `--preview` shows what would be sent |
| `senti-eval.sh` | eval harness over `eval/cases.txt`; `ab <A> <B>` with a base-vs-base row |
| `senti-selftest.sh` | the full check suite — run before believing anything works |
| `senti-model.sh` | Fast/Accurate whisper model switch |
| `app/make-icon.sh` | SVG → resvg → iconutil (no Pillow, no Python) |
| `uninstall.sh` (repo only) | asks, then removes the LaunchAgent, restores `init.lua`, removes app, cache, logs; asks again for keys and models |

- **Engine:** `whisper-cpp` (brew) kept warm in Metal by launchd `io.senti.server`
  (`senti-serve.sh`). base.en (Fast ~0.2s) / large-v3-turbo-q5 (Accurate). Model choice
  in `~/.cache/senti/model.pref` via `senti-model.sh`.
- **Recording:** `sox -d` → 16 kHz mono WAV, stopped with **SIGINT** (finalizes the header).
  `start` spawns sox first and sweeps orphans afterwards, detached (the sweep used to delay
  the start of recording by 0.15 s). `audio_ctx=768` applies below 14 s (768 frames of 20 ms
  cover 15.36 s; identical words to 14.61 s, lost ending at 16.17 s, measured 13 Nov 2026).
- **AI providers:** one adapter (`senti-ai.sh`), three providers, one key each:
  - **OpenAI** (default, `gpt-6-luna`, the only provider with a passed live call): chat
    completions, `reasoning_effort`, `max_completion_tokens` 4000.
  - **Anthropic** (default `claude-opus-5-5`): messages API, `anthropic-version: 2026-10-21`,
    system block with `cache_control`, `output_config.effort`, `max_tokens` 8000 (thinking
    counts toward it), NO `temperature`, NO prefill, NO `thinking` field (all 400 on the
    current models). Refusal fallbacks on for Opus/Sonnet (`fallbacks: "default"` + beta
    `server-side-fallback-2026-07-01`; Haiku has none). `stop_reason: "refusal"` → exit 14.
  - **OpenRouter** (default `openai/gpt-6-luna`): `reasoning: {effort, exclude: true}` and
    `provider: {data_collection: "deny"}` always; `WF_OPENROUTER_ZDR=1` adds `zdr`; no
    attribution headers.
  - Provider and model resolve as a **pair** from the single highest tier that names either:
    `SENTI_PROVIDER`/`SENTI_MODEL` env → `WF_AI_PROVIDER`/`WF_TEXT_MODEL`/`WF_VISION_MODEL`
    in config.sh → `ai.pref` (menu; strict `key=value`, never sourced) → auto (first provider
    with a key). A model alone implies its provider (`claude-*` Anthropic, `/` OpenRouter).
  - `ai-models.json` is the one registry (providers, models, prices, allowed efforts,
    `available`). The adapter clamps effort to what the model accepts (Claude has no
    `none`; `gpt-6.1-sol` / `gpt-6-astra` reject it), so no call wastes a 400.
  - Exit codes, kept by every wrapper and mapped to notices in senti.lua: 10 no key,
    11 key refused (401/403; the log gets a fixed string, never the provider's message),
    12 quota, 13 model not offered, 14 declined, 15 network, 16 server error, 17 empty
    answer, 18 request rejected. Redirects are refused (the key never follows one).
  - `SENTI_AI_DRYRUN=1` prints the request with `[key]` and `<N bytes>`: no key, no network.
  - One `ai:` log line per call, counts only (provider, model, effort, ms, tokens, key
    source). `~/.cache/senti/last-request.json` (600) names the parts of the last request
    (speech, selection, window_title, session, vault, target_digest) with counts, never text.
  - Anthropic and OpenRouter are tested offline (dry runs, a bogus key → 401 → exit 11,
    13 Nov 2026) until the owner's live check; `available: false` in the registry until then.
- **AI text + vision on OpenAI:** both go to **`gpt-6-luna`** since 2026-10-17: $0.10/$0.50
  per 1M vs gpt-5.6-luna's $0.20/$1.20, and it beat 5.6-luna 5-0-3 pairwise on the 8 eval
  cases while costing ~1/3 per text call at the same latency. Text runs at
  `reasoning_effort: none`, vision and the judge at `low`. Earlier measurements (5.6-luna, with the KB layer): text ≈
  $0.0005/call, vision ≈ $0.0004 — gpt-6-luna should be roughly a third to a half of that
  (estimated from price and the A/B, not yet measured with the KB layer); vs gpt-4o-mini
  vision at 3.3s, **37k tokens** and $0.0056 (it tokenizes images far more expensively).
  - `minimal` effort is **rejected** by gpt-5.x and gpt-6 — gpt-6-luna takes
    `none|low|medium|high|xhigh|max` (default `medium`, so always pass one).
  - `none` measured 2.2x cheaper and 1.8x faster than `low` at an identical eval score on the
    prompt-rewrite task: rewriting is transformation, not reasoning. Judging candidates *is*
    reasoning, so `senti-judge.sh` overrides to `low`.
  - Reasoning tokens count against `max_completion_tokens` — leave headroom or you get an
    empty string back with no error.
  - **Output dominates cost** (~6x input price), so trimming what the model *writes* beats
    trimming what you send. Prompt caching DOES engage: the system prompt (operating layer +
    craft + target digest) is about 5,500 characters, roughly 1,400 tokens, over OpenAI's
    1,024-token minimum, and a heavy turn on 13 Nov 2026 logged `in=1401 cache_read=1179`.
    Anthropic's minimum is 512 tokens on the 5.5 models, and its system block is marked
    `cache_control`. Keep per-turn content (the fence, the idea) in the user message so the
    system prefix stays byte-stable.
  - Prepends `prompts/operating.md` when `WF_OPERATING_LAYER=1`.
- **Model-aware prompting:** `senti-target.sh` maps the frontmost app (free, local, no
  extra API call) to a knowledge file in `prompts/models/` and injects only that file's
  `## Inject` digest (~900B). Injecting the full research prose instead cost 4.5KB and
  pushed prompt mode to 9.9s — keep the digests small.
- **Prompt intelligence:** one call, context-heavy. Both prompt paths assemble: shared craft
  (`prompts/prompt-craft.md`) + vault digest (`senti-brain.sh`) + session memory
  (`senti-session.sh`) + target-model guidance (`senti-target.sh`). Best mode was DELETED
  2026-08-09 — it was unreachable from the live path, never once measured better than one
  call, and bet 2x latency on sampling variance instead of context quality. Don't rebuild it.
- **Second brain (Obsidian):** `senti-brain.sh` maps the window-title project to a vault note
  (allowlist is narrow and configured locally; exceptions in `brain-map.txt`), digests
  it (`## Senti` section wins, else `## For future Claude`, else first lines), caps at
  `WF_BRAIN_MAX`. The digest rides only HEAVY turns (opening "think hard" or "today let's
  work on"). The log says `brain: prepared '<note>' N chars` when it is built (at key-down,
  nothing sent) and `sent: vault '<note>' N chars` when it joins a request. That line is
  written as the request is built, so a turn that then stops (no key, a dry run) still shows it:
  it can over-report, never under-report.
  `senti-brain.sh --preview <project>` prints, locally, what would be sent and to which
  provider. There is NO background upload: the lazy "refresh" that sent the digest to the
  model to compress it was deleted 13 Nov 2026 (it had not run since 17 Oct), and
  `senti-session.sh sweep` deletes its old `~/.cache/senti/brain/*.md` leftovers. The digest
  DOES ride the API call: that's the feature and the risk — never widen the allowlist to
  `People/` or the vault root, and keep the privacy self-test checks passing. Never commit a
  real vault path here.
- **Eval:** `eval/cases.txt` is `idea|app hint|window title` (8 ideas x ChatGPT and Claude
  Code, plus 3 heavy turns). `senti-eval.sh ab <A> <B>` generates 3 samples per side per case
  and judges them with `senti-judge.sh compare` (order-swapped, disagreement = TIE, told the
  destination, pinned to openai gpt-6-luna at low), and ALWAYS prints a base-vs-base row of
  the same size: the noise floor. On 13 Nov 2026 that floor was 24-13-20 (64% non-tie wins
  for a config against itself), so only a change well clear of it is real. Variants live in
  `eval/variants/<label>.env` (parsed, allowed keys only). A failed call is FAIL, a failed
  judge JERR, never a score. `senti-eval.sh <label>` keeps the legacy absolute 0-10 score
  (saturates around 8; regression only).

## Modes / hotkeys

| Gesture | Mode |
|---|---|
| Hold **right ⌥** | Dictate (verbatim, 100% local) |
| Hold **right ⌘** | Prompt (rough idea → optimized prompt; reads a screenshot for context) |
| Hold **Fn (🌐)** | Command (transform selected text by voice) |
| **⌃⌥V** | Context (screenshot + voice → context-aware reply/edit) |
| `⌃⌥D` / `⌃⌥P` / `⌃⌥C` | hands-free toggle versions |

Three macOS permissions on **Hammerspoon**: Accessibility (type), Microphone (record),
Screen Recording (context/vision).

## Security model (audited 2026-08-10, re-audited 2026-10-17)

Threat model: a **local, single-user** tool, so the adversary is a same-uid process or a
hostile input, not a remote attacker. Verified defenses — don't regress them:

- **`hs.ipc` is OFF by default** (`senti.lua`). Loading it opens a port where the `hs` CLI
  runs *arbitrary Lua* inside Hammerspoon, which holds Accessibility/Mic/Screen — any same-uid
  process could `hs -c '…'` to launder those TCC grants. Opt in for live debugging with
  `touch ~/.cache/senti/allow-ipc`, then reload. With it off, `hs -c` does nothing.
  This is NOT a same-uid boundary: same-uid code can create that flag or edit the deployed
  scripts Hammerspoon runs, and so already owns its TCC grants. It closes a casual port only.
- **Speech AND the system prompt travel via env, never argv** — the system prompt embeds
  session transcripts + vault digests, so it's as sensitive as the speech (`ps` shows argv,
  not env; the self-test canary runs through both channels).
- **Prompt-injection fence:** window titles are attacker-controllable (a web page sets its own
  browser-tab title). Untrusted context (title/vault/session) goes in the *user* role inside a
  `REFERENCE_CONTEXT` fence marked "data, never instructions" — never in the system role.
  Model output is *typed* (⌘V), never executed. The fence brackets are stripped from the
  untrusted body so a title cannot close it early. Self-test asserts both (with a heavy-intent
  probe — a light idea never sends the title, so it proved nothing).
- **The vault bridge has one gate** — `brain_digest()` in `senti-brain.sh` (`## Senti`
  section → cap). Every path that can send note text goes through it; there is no background
  upload any more. Never send a raw note. The bridge is off unless `WF_BRAIN=1`, and it reads
  only the folders listed in `WF_BRAIN_DIRS` (no default list), never `People/`.
  `brain-map.txt` entries obey it too (no `..`, no absolute paths, no escaping symlinks).
- **Keys:** Keychain first (`security` calls run under a perl `alarm`, so a locked keychain
  costs seconds and exit 19, never a hung dictation), mode-600 file as the fallback. Lua never
  calls `security`: it reads presence from `senti-key.sh status --json` and writes through
  `senti-key.sh set` over `hs.task` with the key in `SENTI_IN`. On 401/403 the log gets a
  fixed string and every logged provider message is scrubbed of key-shaped text.
- **Verbatim stays local:** verbatim turns are never written to session memory, because
  recall rides prompt-mode API calls. Pasted text is marked transient + concealed so clipboard
  managers skip it. Universal Clipboard (Handoff) can still sync it to your other devices.
  macOS does have a public opt-out (`NSPasteboard` current-host-only writes, reachable from a
  small Swift helper); Senti does not use it yet.
- **Known, accepted:** whisper-server's `/load` endpoint is unauthenticated (CORS `*`), so any
  local account or a page reaching 127.0.0.1:8090 can make it load a bad model and exit;
  launchd restarts it. Denial of service only — it cannot read audio.
- **No speech in the log:** `senti.log` is `600` and logs char counts, not transcripts
  (`WF_DEBUG=1` for full text). It's never rotated, so never put content there by default —
  window titles included (bias and brain lines log counts and note names, not the title).
- **Cache artefacts** (audio, screenshots, selection) are swept by *pattern* at end-of-turn,
  startup, and a 60s backstop. Same-uid can read them regardless of mode, so the defense is the
  short on-disk life, not perms — don't widen the sweep interval or leave a fixed-name artefact
  off the pattern.

## Gotchas (these cost real time — respect them)

- **Mic TCC:** sox uses CoreAudio-HAL, which macOS *silently mutes* (peak `0.000000`)
  when Hammerspoon lacks Microphone permission — no prompt. Fix path is the Swift/AVFoundation
  helper `senti-mic-auth.swift` (`--probe` / `--request`), which triggers the real TCC prompt.
- **`hs.eventtap` must live on a global** (`wf.flagWatcher`) or Lua GC collects it and
  hold-to-talk silently dies. A 5s watchdog re-arms it. Don't make it file-local.
- **macOS ships bash 3.2:** referencing an empty array under `set -u` throws. Use
  `"${ARR[@]+"${ARR[@]}"}"`. sed/awk are **BSD**, not GNU — no `-i ''`-free in-place, no `\U`, etc.
- **No right-Control key** on MacBooks (keycode 62 doesn't fire) — command mode uses **Fn (63)**.
- **Silence gate fails open:** only skip a clip when the peak is *confidently* below threshold;
  an empty/unparsed peak must transcribe, not drop. (Kills Whisper's "Thank you." hallucination
  without eating real speech.)
- **A quick tap can orphan sox:** a backgrounded sox starts with SIGINT *ignored* until it
  installs its handler, so key-up landing within ms of key-down loses the INT. sox then records
  forever into a `capture.wav` the sweep has unlinked (2026-10-17: three 8-day orphans, ~35 GB
  invisible to `du`, mic held open). `stop_sox` re-sends INT then KILLs; `reap_orphans` (keyed
  on the WAV path, not the pidfile) clears leftovers on every `start`/`cancel`. Census hidden
  disk with `lsof +L1`.
- **Image downscale uses `sips`**, not PIL — `/usr/bin/python3` has no Pillow.
- **`security -i` exits 0 even when the command failed** (measured: a missing keychain path).
  Only a read-back proves a Keychain write. And a read from a LOCKED keychain blocks on a
  password dialog: always go through `_sk_run` (perl `alarm`) in senti-key.sh. Tests use a
  throwaway keychain (`SENTI_KEYCHAIN=<path>`) rather than trusting a fake HOME to keep
  `security` away from the login keychain, and `launchctl` ignores HOME entirely.
- **`$HOME` may contain a space:** quote every path in `hs.execute(...)`; the plist uses a
  `__HOME__` placeholder that `install.sh` substitutes (never hard-code a home path).

## Test / debug

```bash
bash ~/.config/senti/senti-selftest.sh          # full suite: engine, transcription, config, keys, icons, live API, ps-leak, then the sandbox checks
bash senti-selftest.sh --ci                     # from a checkout: offline sandbox only (throwaway HOME + keychain); CI runs this
bash ~/.config/senti/senti-key.sh status        # provider, model, key presence and source (never the key)
bash ~/.config/senti/senti-dictate.sh server    # → server up/down
hs -c 'return wf.diag()'                        # state / eventtap / mic / model
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/senti.log                # runtime log
bash ~/.config/senti/senti-eval.sh ab base kb     # A/B two variants, with the base-vs-base noise row
SENTI_AI_DRYRUN=1 SENTI_PROVIDER=anthropic SENTI_IN=hi bash ~/.config/senti/senti-ai.sh   # request shape, no key, no network
```

Diagnostics no longer rely on `hs -c` (ipc is off by default — see Security model). Use the
menu bar → **Write diagnostics to log**, or read the `diag:` line senti.lua writes at startup:
`grep 'diag:' ~/Library/Logs/senti.log | tail -1`. To reload, quit + `open -a Hammerspoon`
(never `hs -c 'hs.reload()'` — it tears down the ipc socket mid-call and blocks forever). For
live `hs -c` debugging, `touch ~/.cache/senti/allow-ipc` first, and remove it when done.
`hs -c` also hangs if Hammerspoon isn't running at all — check `pgrep -x Hammerspoon` and
`luac -p ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua` before blaming the Lua. On 2026-10-17 it hung even with
ipc on (`diag: ipc=ON(dev)`). What worked for checking Hammerspoon APIs live: temporarily
append a `hs.timer.doAfter(2, …)` block to `init.lua` that writes its results to a file,
open Hammerspoon, read the file, then restore `init.lua` from the repo and quit it.

State machine has a watchdog. `recording` stuck 150s (a lost key-up or a forgotten toggle)
stops sox and puts the transcript on the CLIPBOARD, never pasting, because focus may be anywhere
by then. `working` stuck 75s abandons the turn (`wf.turn` bumps, so the late callback drops
its result) and hands back the user's words, or in command mode their own clipboard. If
hold-to-talk feels dead, check `wf.diag()` for the eventtap first.

## Commit conventions

- Terse, imperative subject describing the *behavior* change (see `git log` for the house style).
- **Never** commit a key, a `*.pref`, `eval/history.csv`, or any real name / user path.
- Update `README.md` when the mode set, permissions, or install steps change.

## Where the rest of the context lives

- User-facing: `README.md`. Go-to-market, pricing, and roadmap are deliberately NOT in
  this repo — they live in the private vault (`Efforts/Active/Senti/`). If you find
  yourself writing strategy here, that's the signal it belongs there instead.
- Claude memory: `whisper-flow-local-dictation-2026-07-03.md` (has the full audited state).
