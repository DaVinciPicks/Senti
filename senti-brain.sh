# off by default and independent of each other:
#   Obsidian  WF_BRAIN=1 and the vault folders listed in WF_BRAIN_DIRS
#   Notion    WF_BRAIN_NOTION=1, a token (senti-key.sh set notion) and a page mapped in
#             brain-map.txt
#
#   senti-brain.sh <project-hint>             # the Obsidian digest for a project
#   senti-brain.sh --notion                   # the Notion digest for the project in
#                                             # SENTI_SLABEL (heavy turns only, see below)
#   senti-brain.sh --retrieve                 # one more note from the project's vault
#                                             # folder that matches the words in SENTI_Q
#                                             # (WF_BRAIN_RETRIEVE=1, heavy turns only)
#   senti-brain.sh --preview <project-hint>   # print, locally, what would ride a heavy
#                                             # Prompt turn and where it would go. Sends
#                                             # nothing to the AI provider; it may read the
#                                             # mapped Notion page from Notion.
#
# Prints a capped digest, or nothing. Obsidian sources, in order:
#   1. an explicit mapping in brain-map.txt (project|path/to/note.md, vault-relative)
#   2. an allowlisted dir whose name matches the project → its <dir>/<dir>.md
#      (or the single .md inside, if the convention isn't followed)
# Notion source: only an explicit mapping, "project|notion:<page id or notion.so URL>" (or
# "project = notion:..."). Senti never calls Notion's search endpoint (that would send the
# project name), and the integration only sees pages the user shared with it.
#
# PRIVACY MODEL — read before widening anything here:
#   - Whatever this prints can be injected into prompt mode and then RIDES THE API CALL to
#     the active AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic or OpenRouter). That is the entire point,
#     and also the entire risk. It rides only heavy turns (senti_intent in senti-lib.sh).
#   - So: only the folders listed in WF_BRAIN_DIRS are ever searched. There is no
#     default list, and the Obsidian bridge is off unless WF_BRAIN=1.
#   - Notes and folders that resolve outside the listed folders, including through
#     symlinks, are ignored and logged as "ignored (outside the allowlist)".
#   - Digest is hard-capped (WF_BRAIN_MAX chars). A note (or Notion page) can control
#     exactly what Senti sees by adding a "Senti" heading: then ONLY that section is used.
#   - The log says "brain: prepared" when a digest is built (for Obsidian that happens at
#     key-down, when nothing has left the Mac) and senti-lib.sh logs "sent: vault" or
#     "sent: notion" when a digest joins a request, as the request is built: a turn that then
#     stops (no key, a dry run) still shows it, so it can over-report but never
#     under-report. Kill switches: WF_BRAIN=0, WF_BRAIN_NOTION=0.
#   - Notion is read only on a heavy turn, after the speech is transcribed, and only for a
#     project mapped to a page; never at key-down. The request carries the page id and the
#     token, nothing from the speech or the window title. The gated digest (never the raw
#     page) is kept in ~/.cache/senti/brain/notion-<page id>.txt (mode 600) for
#     WF_NOTION_TTL_MIN minutes so the next heavy turn does not wait on Notion again.
#   - Retrieval (WF_BRAIN_RETRIEVE=1, needs WF_BRAIN=1) adds at most ONE more note per heavy
#     turn: the best keyword match (SQLite FTS5, bm25, in memory, nothing written to disk)
#     for what the user said, among the notes in the SAME project folder as the matched
#     note, above a score threshold. The index holds exactly what the gate would send for
#     each listed note (never a raw body), built per turn after transcription; the query
#     reaches python in the environment. Notes under People/, hidden folders and symlinks
#     are never indexed, and a project folder that IS a listed folder is not a project
#     folder, so nothing is retrieved from it.
#   - There is no background upload. A lazy background step that sent the digest to the
#     model to compress it was deleted on 13 Nov 2026: it had not run since 17 Oct (the
#     key-down prefetch disabled it) and it was one more upload than the feature needs.
#   - Verbatim dictation never touches this script.

#   a "For future Claude" section → already written for AI consumption
#   else                       → the first 10 body lines after the frontmatter
# A section is the lines after a heading of any level (# to ######) whose whole text is the
# name, up to the next heading of the same or a higher level. ("## Senti" sections end at
# the next "#" or "##" heading; Notion headings arrive as #, ##, ### or ####.)
# Wiki-link noise stripped, hard-capped at WF_BRAIN_MAX bytes. This is the ONE gate that
# keeps private note content from leaving the Mac: every path that can send note text
