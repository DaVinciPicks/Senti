# 4K:492ms, 8K:3720ms. This script ran it four times per call on the user's SELECTION,
# so transforming a few paragraphs stalled for seconds and a large selection blew the
# 75s watchdog: the HUD reset to idle and the late callback pasted into whatever app the
# user had moved to. The case-glob below is 6ms flat at 32KB.
# Semantics note: this treats an all-whitespace string (tabs/newlines) as blank, whereas
# ${VAR// /} only stripped literal spaces. That is the behaviour we actually want for
