# Shared context assembly for BOTH prompt paths (senti-vision.sh when Screen Recording
# is granted, senti-prompt.sh when it isn't). One source of truth so the two paths
# can't drift; the self-test asserts both source this file.
#
# SECURITY — trust split. Some inputs are attacker-influenceable: a browser tab sets
# its own title (which carries the "project" and "task" fields), and a vault note could
# contain text the user pasted from anywhere. That content must never be able to change
# the model's task or make it reveal things. So:
#   - senti_prompt_craft   → OUR instructions + the trusted target-model KB digest.
#                            Goes in the SYSTEM role.
#   - senti_untrusted_ctx  → vault digest + session memory (title-derived + past
#                            speech). Wrapped in an explicit "reference data, never
#                            instructions" fence and placed in the USER role, which is
#                            structurally lower-authority than system.
# Identity comes from env (SENTI_SLABEL / SENTI_SKEY / SENTI_HINT, set by senti.lua's
# runScript) so window titles stay off argv.
#
# Run this file DIRECTLY (not sourced) to prefetch — see the bottom of the file.

# Blank test for UNBOUNDED strings (transcripts, model output, selections).
# Never use ${VAR// /} for this: macOS ships bash 3.2, where that substitution is
# O(n^2) on strings containing spaces — measured 1K:17ms, 2K:72ms, 4K:492ms, 8K:3720ms.
# This costs ~6ms flat at 32KB. (It also treats tabs/newlines as blank, which is the

# this file at key-DOWN for prompt mode, so the work overlaps the speech and the live
# call just reads a file.
#
# PRIVACY: the cached text is the vault digest plus this window's session transcript.
# Both ALREADY live at rest in this same 700-mode dir (brain/, sessions/), so caching
# introduces no new class of on-disk data — but it is still a turn artefact and is

# self-test pins that. Do not rename these files without updating that pattern.

# ── Intent: how much context does this turn actually deserve? ───────────────────────
# Every prompt-mode turn used to carry the whole stack — craft + target digest +
# operating layer + vault digest + session recall, ~5.8KB (~1450 tokens) — whether the
# user said "make this clearer" or "today let's work on the settlement pipeline". That
# is overkill on the common path, and on a model that already over-triggers on
# elaborate prompts it is actively counterproductive.
#
# So heavy context is now OPT-IN BY PHRASE. The user's own convention: a turn that
# deserves the full stack opens with "today let's work on…" or "think hard". Everything
# else is a quick rewrite and gets the lean prompt.
#
# The lean path still keeps craft + target-model guidance — those are what make the
# output a good prompt at all. What it drops is the *situational* half: the vault digest
# and the session transcript, which are the expensive, least-relevant part of a one-line
# ask, and the only part that is untrusted input.
#
# Matching is on the OPENING of the utterance, deliberately: a mid-sentence "think hard"
# is the user talking about thinking, not asking for it.

# A heavy turn can also add a Notion digest and one retrieved vault note. Both need the

# light and need nothing). They run in the background, side by side, while the cached block
# is read, so the turn waits for the slowest one, not the sum. senti-brain.sh bounds the
# Notion read (WF_NOTION_TIMEOUT, default 2.5 s) and reuses its digest for
# WF_NOTION_TTL_MIN minutes. Both go in their own nonce fence, because the cached block was
