# Senti uninstaller: removes what install.sh put on this Mac, after asking.
#   ./uninstall.sh            asks before each step (the default answer is always No)
#   ./uninstall.sh --yes      removes Senti itself without asking; keeps your settings,
#                             API keys and speech models
#   ./uninstall.sh --yes --all   also removes settings, keys and speech models
#
# What "Senti itself" means here, all of it written by install.sh:
#   ~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.senti.server.plist   the warm whisper server (stopped first)
#   ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua                        restored from the newest
#                                                  init.lua.pre-senti.* backup, if any, and
#                                                  only when the current one is Senti's.
#                                                  The current one is first saved as
#                                                  init.lua.senti-<date>.bak, so edits you
#                                                  made inside Senti's file are kept there.
#   ~/Applications/Senti.app (and ~/Desktop/Senti.app if you made that copy)
#   ~/.cache/senti                                 audio, screenshots, session memory
#   ~/Library/Logs/senti.log, senti-server.log
# Asked separately:
#   ~/.config/senti plus the io.senti items in your macOS Keychain (your API keys and Notion token)
#   ~/.local/share/whisper-models                  the speech models (other tools may use them)
